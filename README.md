# arrange_list

     This program is actually a sorting program. I am not sure what is it called but it works :) .
 In this program you can also  take the numbers in a file(if there is something else it will not work) and then sort them.

 To work on this program, you need 2 things: 
  ->an adress of a integer variable(or a pointer) that stores length of the list you are going to sort
  ->the list(double*)
  NOTE: If you want to parse the numbers from a file you just need an adress of a integer variable. The function will automatically store the length of the list in the variable

I HOPE YOU WILL LIKE IT...
